# Cronos
Cronos is our internal timekeeping system, the core logic of which we are open sourcing.

The goal of cronos is to provide simple visibility into internal accounts, users, billing codes, and worked time. The end goal will be to provide a smooth AP/AR system that can be used both internally and externally at Snowpack.

The internal APIs and website logic is modeled in our internal website so only the core logic of the application is available here.
